# Hello world, I'm Sonda!

![Portfolio Picture](https://www.linkedin.com/mpr/pub/image-PAc4ersDkqdkc0zvvamVvk78urQHIvkOkASxZNbFu0LoImN_PAcxkEPDuES1Qnc4P961/sonda-sengupta.jpg)

Hi all, I'm an apprentice developer currently studying software development at the Nashville Software School. Right now, my interests are in front end development such as CSS and Javascript.

I come from a technical support background, although I spent much of my years in college in the scientific research world studying neuroscience and philosophy.

If you would like to know more about my work background please visit my [LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/sonda-sengupta/57/121/948).
