It's hard to find the right person. When you add a new member to a team, you are multiplying the amount of new relationships that must form between the new hire and each team member. If you are job candidate, you know preparing for an interview is a no-brainer. This fact is also very true as an interviewer too, especially if your entire team is conducting multiple interviews. It is so easy as a developer to think that there are more important things to do, and come into an interview ill-prepared. But often winging an interview means an unproductive interview.
 
## Some things to watch out for:
Own the interview. This means to make sure that you cover the topics and questions that you need to cover. Nervous candidates may talk long after a question has been answered. Colleagues may focus on one single point to question for an unproductively long period of time when there is more to cover. You yourself may be too long-winded in an explanation.

Stay away from illegal questions. Some are obvious like race, religion, or family -- but others are less obvious such as inadvertently asking leading questions. You may think that you are making pleasant conversation about a candidate's commute, but it could actually turn into an illegal question where the person's area of town gives clues to race/ethnicity.
 
## Have a team process before conducting an interview.
Discuss what an ideal candidate would bring to the table in terms of knowledge, experience, culture. Make sure everyone in the interview knows what position is being hired for, and they all have a good idea what should be expected of a new hire.

Have a master list of questions ready which is very helpful in interviewing multiple candidates. Have this printed out and distributed among team members.

Disperse resumes early.  If the candidate's resume is passed out beforehand, it may give team members time to use it to check a candidate's LinkedIn Profile, Github, etc to know more about the person. During the interview itself, every person should have a resume, even if it is only to jot down notes and impressions. It's very easy when interview multiple candidates for interviews to run together, so notes and impressions on resumes can really help memory.

Have an opening statement and closing statement to make the interview process feel smooth. 

## Nice Lists to Facilitate Interviews
- selling points and highlights about your company
- master list of interview questions, both technical and cultural
- any talking points or questions produced by resume or background info
- selling points and highlights of the team/project/department/role you are interviewing for.
