There are some fields that are more fast paced than others. Sometimes, I think if I was an illustrator, an author, or a musician then perhaps inspiration maybe more of a problem then the constantly deteriorating learning curve I find in technology. It is a feature of software development that can be both fun and hard. 

As this field matures, maintaining knowledge is becoming increasingly difficult. Javascript fatigue is real. Relevancy can be overwhelming. And do you really know whether your coworker is talking about a new framework or a next gen Pokemon? 

As someone with a background in studying learning and memory in human beings, knowledge acquisition in software development is a problem I find extremely interesting. What is the best way to learn in software development? What is a system or set of workflows that would work for me and perhaps others? It has taken me a couple of years to formulate an acceptable answer. With some digging, I have found a few truths.

### There is very little documentation at the bleeding edge.
What did you expect? When you’re the trailblazer, the learning curve is extremely high.  With great glory comes great cost when you are the first to implement something completely new for your team, for your company, or perhaps for your field. Sometimes it means hours of odd debugging sessions. Sometimes it means finding that one line in that one article somewhere on the internet that was sort of but not quite similar to your problem. Sometimes it means being alone with no coworkers, or even the internet, to help you because you are discovering something entirely new. 

As a good trailblazer, leaving documentation behind in your wake becomes extremely important. It adds to the collective knowledge so people who follow your path can have an easier time. As you go farther into the bleeding edge, learning materials become hard to come by and so more time and effort are required to reach the results. Which leads me to my next point...

### Good learning materials make learning curves smaller. 
So you’ve decided to learn ECMAShiny Javascript, eh? Do you have a learning plan? Do you know what materials you are going to use to learn it? Of course, you don’t have to have any sort of plan or strategy. As with most things in life, winging it is always an option and sometimes it works quite well. 

However, I have found the learning curve is shortest when you have materials that work well for you. Now that you have made a decision to learn a thing, gather a list of resources-- books, articles, podcasts, tutorials and sites of the thing in question. Then prioritize it. Don’t just start going through the first one. Cull the list to a few resources that you think are the most promising -- perhaps even by certain subtopics that one book may help where another does not. All it takes is a quick Amazon search to find the most popular books on the subject. Perhaps, just asking a friend who is farther long is all is that is required.

If the material is important enough for your time and effort, make sure you have the best resources at your disposal. Don’t pick something just because it is free. Don’t pick something just because it is first on search results. 

### Keep your tech mindmap current, but don’t sweat the details.
Software development is big enough to contain specialties. Know which fields you want to maintain expertise. Front end? Back end? Dev Ops? Mobile?  There are so many to choose, and on top of that each has their own subset of technologies that are continuously rising and falling in popularity. You need to know the trends of your field. This may mean subscribing to popular websites on the topic, looking through a subreddit daily, or doing some trend research yourself. As you get a sense of the atmosphere, you will notice a trend in popularity with certain keywords that keep popping up. For example, some time ago in the front end space, there were murmerings of Vue. If you followed newsletters, websites, and subreddits on the topic, Vue started to pop up more and more and as such a developer gets curious as to what’s the deal with this upcoming new thing.

After you’ve recognized a trend, learn where the tech fits. Why is it becoming popular? Why do people like it, and what are its pitfalls? What problem is it trying to address and perhaps what comparable technologies rival it. And that’s it. All you need is to recognize where it fits into all other tech buzzwords in the field. You don’t have to know how to code in it. You don’t have to know how to implement it. Just know where it fits and why, so that when you or your team has a problem, then you can decide whether this tech would help. 

Continuing with Vue, this Javascript framework was comparing itself against Angular, Ember, and React. People loved it at the time because it was simple to use, fast, and felt closer to Javascript than some competitors. Back then, I decided to go no further in learning how to actually code it. Why? Because I didn't need to. Recently, however, my team is deciding what tools we should use in our new front end application, and Vue is one of our options. Now would be a good time to actually code up a prototype just to see how it stacks up.

Often, you need to know about a technology insofar as what its good for and how it stack up against others within its problem domain. Details are needed only when you want to go deeper. Then you can learn the nitty gritty details of implementation. This is called Just In Time Learning. 

### It is a great boon to be paid to learn. Use it wisely.
The last point is more on the topic of personal time management. You will always be learning in software development in order to stay relevant. You will always be spending some time gaining skills if you want to further your career. But when its on company time, it is two-for-one deal where you are getting paid AND you are learning. You are getting paid for something that you must do otherwise on personal time, which is quite a wonderful thing really. So the next time you are spending time doing professional development at your workplace, please do not treat as menial, dead space time between your real job of coding. It ought to have just as much consideration.
