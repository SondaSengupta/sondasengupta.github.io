Software development is full of fundamentals that build on each other to create complex topics. For example, describe Domain Driven Architecture to a layman. Within this one word, there are other complex topics like aggregate roots, entities, value objects, ubitiquitous langauge, etc. How do you know that you really know it?

### What is the Feynman Technique
The Feynman technique is named after Richard Feynman who is known for being able to explain very complex physics concepts in simple ways.

### How the Feynman Technique Works
1. Figure out the topic you want to learn.
2. On a page, write down all the concepts you know about the topic and a list of all the concepts you don’t know about the topic that you need to learn.
3. For each concept, first write the concept's name as the title on the page. Next, explain the concept using simple language, as if you were explaining it to a friend.
4. As you work on explaining each concept, you will naturally identify problem areas – areas that you are having difficulty explaining in simple terms. Add what concepts you are unclear on to your don’t know list.
5. Go through your don’t know list and fill in gaps that you don’t understand clearly. Add sources to them, so you can revisit it when you need to reunderstand it later.

In this way, you are able to test yourself on all concepts and subconcepts as well as identify any gaps you have as you are explaining it to yourself. It is simple, but a powerful technique. And if you keep these pages of notes, it will help jog your memory when it is time to reremember the material.
