Coding at Hack Nashville 6!

When I attended HackNashville 5, I knew absolutely nothing about coding. I was in beginning of my career transition and I had taken a few tutorials on CodeAcademy about HTML. When I heard about HackNashville 5, I jumped in just to see what it was about. I ended up joining the Girl Geek Dinner group and helped write content for their upcoming website catering to female high school students interested in computer science.

But this time, just a few months later at HackNashville 6, I’m here again and I’m coding! To go from thinking Javascript and Java were the same thing to contributing code as part of the front end team in just a few short months is absolutely rewarding. This time I was part of the Code for Nashville group who wanted to create an app that allowed homeowners to get a feel for the neighborhood’s community ammenities and common rankings for crime, education, etc. I met some great people and reconnected with a few old ones that I only every chance upon at such events. All in all, I’m excited to see how much I can accomplish and learn by the time HackNashville 7 rolls around.
