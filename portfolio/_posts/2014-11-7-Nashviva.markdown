## About the App

This was a proof of concept app that was pitched during HackNashville 6. The members of Code for Nashville wanted to create an app that could look up the amenities of your neighborhood in a simple way. In this project, I mainly handled the styling elements such as creating the switches, background styling, and icons. However, during the down hours I ended up learning a bit more about the open source maps API called LeafLet and a lot about GitHub, working in a team project which involves careful use of Git and GitHub to prevent merge conflicts.

## Features
- By tapping on the switch, it will show you the police stations, free wifi, fire stations, and parks within the Nashville area.
- You can tap on any or all switches to customize the map to view any and all amenities at the same time.
