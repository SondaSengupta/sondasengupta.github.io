##About the App
I created this application while I was sick with my annual winter cold. Each year I get one and each year I don't quite remember exactly which medication and cough drops helped me get better. This Windows desktop app stores your medication and home remedies so that future you can remember how to get better fast.

##Features
- Ability to save your favorite medications, home remedies, and home recipes.
- Easy organization. You can create your own categories separated by commas, and they will autopopulate as choices in dropdown for you to choose by illness.
- You can save images directly from your Windows computer or save the image url from the web.
- All CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations are fully functional
