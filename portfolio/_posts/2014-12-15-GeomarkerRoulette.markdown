##About the App

The concept of this game was borne out the frustration of figuring out street address mapping for my larger project, the Homes for the Holidays site. Unlike, the holiday site, this one is done using the pure Google Maps API interface, not Angular Google Maps.

It was created within two hours as an afternoon diversion and to learn a bit more about Angular and Google Maps. The aim of the game is to guess the correct latitude and longitude coordinates of the bullseye that is randomly generated on the map.

##Features
- Unlimited amount of guessing that will appear as list on the bottom-left of the page.
- By clicking on the Bullseye, an infobox will appear that gives the correct coordinates.
- A quick refresh will result in a new game with the bullseye appear at another random location. However, your guesses are still saved.
