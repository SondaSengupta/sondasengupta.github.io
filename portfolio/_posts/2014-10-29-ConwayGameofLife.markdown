##About the App

This site was one of the earliest ones I've created during the Nashville Software School experience where I was just a budding Javascript programmer at the time. We were still learning tables, if-else statements, and for loops back then.

##Features
- New Game button recreates the board with a whole new configuration to play. You can also press this button during any point in the game to get another configuration.
- Start Game will tick through each generation until either all cells are dead or the game has reached a stable configuration.
- Pause enables you to stop the motion during any point in the game.
