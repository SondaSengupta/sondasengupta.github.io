##About the Game

At the time of this game's creation, I knew almost nothing about games except for an inspiring talk that I heard from Earle Castledine during Nodevember 2014 ([Watch it here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6roNQE8t-c)). Basically, his message was you don't need anything fancy to make a game. Just start.

With that in mind, I went to Global Game Jam and our team created this little gem. It's not built with Unity like every other game at the event; it's just some CSS and Javascript and JQuery. We were blessed to have a wonderful graphic designer and a good storyteller.

The game is about Marta McFly who goes back in time to right the events of the past that had been changed by a well-meaning interloper. Throughout the game, you must make choices and wrong ones result in Marta invariably being trampled.

##Features

- Awesome pixelized graphics with some level of animation during the dinosaur scene.
- An intricate plot in which if you choose poorly, it will send you back to your last decision as opposed to redoing the whole game.
- A randomized scene order that will get you to the end cut scene only after going through all 3 scene plotlines.
- Based (somewhat loosely) on real events. Yes, there was actually a Great Emu War and Van Gogh had a friend named Gaugin.

##The Process
At the Global Game Jam, you have 48 hours to make a game and then present it to the world. AngularJS played a major role in this game which allowed us to use ng-show and ng-hide to keep track of all the buttons and links that moved the plot along. Using SASS allowed each team member to work separately on styling their chosen scene and then we were able to use imports to merge them altogether. The game wasn't without some major merge conflicts that took some riddling to figure out, and we were working on the game right into the last minute before presentations began.

Even though it was barebones, we were applauded for the intricacy of the plotline done in such a short time. It was amazing to meet bona fide Nashville game developers and we all had an awesome time at the event. A special thanks to Dave for the graphics, Mathew for the story and dialogue, and of course my dev team members Alex (we tried adding him in the photo via laptop), Brandon, and Beck.
