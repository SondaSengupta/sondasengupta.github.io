But I don’t know anyone there. I hate going to “networking” events. I’ve only been programming x amount of x and I know nothing at all. I’m not really a developer or web designer or engineer. I don’t even understand the title of the talk. What can I really contribute here? I’m not a “people” person. But I really have to do that [useless] thing that day…

If you are serious about becoming a part of the tech industry, then what’s your excuse for not being *part* of the tech industry? It’s never too late and its never too early either. At HackNashville 6, a thirteen year old went onstage to pitch an idea!. Some of us even allow pets to our tech conferences. Nashville is an extremely welcoming tech community and even if you are the most amateur of beginners, just go to an event to meet us. You will find that we love technology just as much as you and we’ll gladly tell you all about it, if you just give us the chance. We’ll give advice on whatever path you are trekking on and may even introduce you to other people who may help with your career conundrums if you’re pleasing to talk to.

Women especially need not feel excluded because there are meetups especially for us such as the Nashville Women’s Programmer’s Meetup and Girl Geek Dinners. In the real world, development is a team sport, so if you want to play, why not meet the players?
