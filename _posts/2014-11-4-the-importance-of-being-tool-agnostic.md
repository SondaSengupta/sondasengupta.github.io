As a developer, your life becomes technology. Being immersed in it as part of your job makes you very aware of the hardware and software that is out there and soon you will know your favorites. You may prefer using an android to an iPhone and you may prefer writing in a certain language, but preferences are different than tools.

Tools have telos. Technology has telos. Everything in software engineering is for a purpose, and being too opinionated over one technology or another makes it too easy to miss seeing a thing for its true purpose--capabilities and weaknesses and all.

Each programming language was built to solve some perplexing issue, and when one has a favorite, it becomes a bit too easy to fall into patterns. If you love JQuery, but your application only has a few lines of it for a specific function, it may be much faster to look up another Javascript format rather than request the whole library for a few lines of code. You may hate using !important in CSS, but what if that is just what you need?

It is important to be aware of the strengths and weaknesses to each tool, so you know the right time and place to use the code. After all, you would never fault a screwdriver for driving in nails because that is never what it was meant to do. Moreover, you wouldnâ€™t want a contractor to use a nailgun for every lumber job because that is his most favorite tool. We all want the web to be a better place, and being too opinionated about technologies and the people who use them only serves to divide us.
