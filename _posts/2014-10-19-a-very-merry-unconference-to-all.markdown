What, you don't know what an unconference is? It is an unbirthday for technology.

The concept of BarCamp has been around since 2005 and it is an attendee-driven event made by users for users. What that means in practice is that anyone with motivation and sponsorship can create a BarCamp for their hometown, and the content of the event is directly in the attendee's hands.

It's my first time attending BarCamp. I'm an introvert by nature so meeting lots of strangers at a large conference for seven hours is not my most favorite thing to do, but I had a wonderful time. Nashville's tech community is truly a great group filled with helpful, friendly people, so a stranger is just someone that you haven't gotten around to talking to just yet. Within two minutes, you'll be exchanging each other's thoughts about the latest projects and technologies and commenting about the wonderful pie served at lunch.

So what made BarCamp fantastic? For one, it is participant driven. In the morning and afternoon, attendees would go the website and we each had four votes that we could give to the list of talks. Talks that receive the largest number of votes would become more important on the roster warranting larger space, so more people could attend. If you didn't like the talk, there is no obligation to stay. In fact, it is encouraged to walk around and see if you can catch two talks simultaneously if you are so inclined. Second, it is a casual environment where people are here to learn new things, meet up with people, and just have a good time. Even if you don't know your Java from your Javascript, newbie coders can meet some people get more information on their budding interests or at least enjoy the food and the lovely.

I'm looking forward to next year's BarCamp in which we would have another very merry unconference.
