excerpt: "Just because we are embarking on a new vocation does not negate all the richness, experience, and quality from our lives that have led us to where we are."

When you are changing careers or you are just in the beginning stages of a starting a new one for your own, it is easy to fall prey to the belief that you lack skills or qualities. Without experience within your budding career, it is too easy to have tunnel vision about the skills you have not acquired for the job just yet.

But as Eliza, our software instructor, noted, just because we are embarking on a new vocation does not negate all the richness, experience, and quality from our lives that led us to where we are. There are parts within each of us that we enjoy about ourselves, either as core elements of our personality or qualities that we have honed, that will carry no matter life's vicissitude.

For me, one quality I enjoy about myself is my openness to adventure and jumping right into things. I try not to come in too colored by preconceived notions and often I am rewarded with experiences that I would not have had or at least a better understanding of myself by the end. I have traveled abroad although I do not speak the language. I have gone caving though I very much like dislike being caked in dirt and hiked at night though I agree that being on a mountain after sunset without cell service sounds like the start of horror flick cliche. If you are afraid of looking like a foreign fool, you won't experience the cultural details. If you hate the dirt and dampness, you will never see an underground waterfall. And, if you cannot walk in absolute darkness, you will never see how absolutely breath-taking the night sky can be with its millions of stars. I have learned that richness and wonder can be found within discomfort, lack of knowing, and even fear.

Translating to a work environment, it means taking a calculated chance on that risky project that you do not know whether will pan out. It means going to that large event in which you know no one and you have little experience on the topic. It means breaking your routine in order to try something that could be more efficient or more fulfilling in the long run. Opportunities exist in unfamiliar territory, and work is no exception.

On the flip side, I also enjoy my acumen for strategy. I do not mean this within the context of traditional games such as chess or go. I mean in terms of practical real-world concerns that have parameters to maximize and routes to puzzle out. When I wanted to become healthier, I created a vegetable matrix so that I could focus on cultivating a taste and recipe repertoire on the most nutrient-dense foods. When I wanted to write a novel, I created story drafts with possible endings so that I would not be writing myself into a corner. Even when on the outside it looks like I'm jumping into a project or an adventure, I usually have already done my research and have planned alternate and exit strategies if situations require it. Strategy and planning are actually what allows me to be opportunistic and to adventure safely. I may be that person who decides to jump off that bridge because it sounds like fun, but believe me, I will have a bungee cord strapped to my feet and know how to tuck into the water if the cord snaps.

At work, this means knowing the risks and requirements of any project to play it smart. It means planning it right the first time, so you minimize doing it again. It means being aware of your own personal strategies on the job so that you know the difference between doing the research and using "research" as an excuse to keep from plunging in.

I believe that everyone has life qualities that only benefit the job, irrespective of career or work environment. I also believe it's just too easy to see the negative about yourself especially in the beginning.
