title:  "Experiment with Google Web Inspector"

So, I'm quite new to coding, especially considering this is my second week at the Nashville Software School. I tend to code it, save it, and then check my results by refreshing the browser window. It can make troubleshooting a bit slow, but alas, I knew no other way. 

Enter Google Web Inspector. I have used the inspector for Google Chrome in the past in order to study other people's code to see how they create such amazing websites, but I did not realize that was just a fraction of what web inspector can do. By right-clicking your page and clicking "inspect element" you can use web inspector to look at parts of your code to see how they are intereacting with each other. The magnifying glass on the top left within inspector is especially helpful since it allows you to click on elements in your file for more information. You will be able to see the css markup for it on the right and even add to it under the style tab. If you want to just test out codebits such as seeing what a certain javascript regex does, you can click on "Console" and enter the code. When you are done with your experimentation, just refresh the browser and your experimental code will be gone. You can do this to any website and any webpage. Whatever happens, it's all temporary and a quick browser refresh will restore order.

In this way, you can see what works directly in the browser and then make those necessary changes in your file. Or you can see what code makes other websites beautiful without any fear of breaking the internet.
