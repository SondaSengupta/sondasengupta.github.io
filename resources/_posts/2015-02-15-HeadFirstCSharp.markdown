excerpt: "This was a friendly introduction to the .NET world that I used to supplement my more formal education. I loved the variety of examples that really help internalize concepts."

Delving into the .NET Framework can be a dizzying experience and Visual Studio is such a rich IDE that it's easy to get lost. For me, this was my first foray into an object-oriented language as well as using an IDE.

This book made C sharp concepts much easier to understand. It was as if there was a patient teacher telling me what was going on, saying it one way at first, then another, and then providing 3 or 4 examples as to its usage. Then at the end or sometimes halfway through just when I had a half-baked question in mind, it was answered by one of the explanations provided in the "Dumb Questions" column. This is a book for novice to intermediate programmers so it is by no means comprehensive of the .NET framework, but the core things it does cover, it covers very well.

## Features
- Concepts are given throughout multiple examples, many of which involve you making your own small coding program.
- There are multiple non-coding exercises as well to test your understanding of definitions and the material.
- I found it relatively easy to skip around to read the material I needed if I wanted to know a particular concept right away.

## Not for...
- If you want to understand how to hook up databases to your C sharp program. This was just a personal thing I needed done, but the book did provide an intro to LINQ. Again, not a comprehensive .NET book.
- A quick read. This book is a hefty 1100 pages, but since I bought the digital version, size did not matter to me.
- If you have an earlier version of Windows (not Windows 8). This book was made for Windows 8 and Visual Studio 2010-2013. If you have an earlier version of software, an earlier edition would be better.
