I have to say that I love this book. It is a very clear, instructive guide on web usability that doesn't hurt your brain or leave you feeling like you want to take a nap.

The main premise is exactly what the title says. Don't make the user think about your web page. The interaction should feel so natural that the user can get to where s/he is going without thought. The author then proceeds to hammer out the details as to how you can make this happen with a variety of visual cues, layout schemes, and common patterns.

On top of this, the book practices what it preaches. The content of the book is also easy to locate, easy to digest, and gives you what you want to know quickly. It has directly influenced the design of my own web pages, including how I create navigation menus and design buttons.

As a budding web developer, this book is a must for your development shelf. For others who have to build their own site like small business owners, entrepreneurs, and volunteers this book will give you some good examples on the layout of your web pages to maximize their effectiveness.

##Little Gems I've Learned

- Give the user a home button. It's way to recenter themselves if they become very lost in the pages and an easy way to return back to the beginning. Most of the time a logo of your site is a sufficient marker.
- Give users some sense of navigation. Whether it is a navbar that is continually at the top or a list describing page hierarchy, it helps ease the difficulty of mentally mapping out your site.
- The back button is the most used button on a site. The user won't hold it against you if they use the back button multiple times as long as the flurry of mindless clicks leads to their destination.

Even if you can't get your hands on the latest version, any version will do since they all are packed with good material that will leave you with a better understanding of user experience.
