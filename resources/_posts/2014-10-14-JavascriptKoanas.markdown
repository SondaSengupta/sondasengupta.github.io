This may not be the best way to learn your very first language if you are completely new to programming in general because the whole concept of learning through testing will seem foreign to you. Syntax errors within the code, no matter whether it's Javascript or Qunit, will cause the whole program to fail, which can be frustrating if you are so new you don't know the difference between what's Qunit and Javascript. However, if you are familiar with unit testing and want to learn the nuances of a language very quickly, koans are a dirty, efficient way to do it.

These Javascript koans were made by Liam Clennan and uses the Qunit syntax and test runner. This learning environment was based off the book Javascript: The Good Parts. You will start off with a bunch of failing tests that you have to redo the code to make pass. As you complete each file section, you will learn more about Javascript ways and the Qunit test runner will reward you with a happy blue bar indicating that you passed the file.

Koans in general are a very interesting way to learn since you are essentially coding to learn more coding. And if you are familiar with testing frameworks or test-driven development, then these koans use the same exact rules just within the concept of learning rather than for robust code creation. And once completed, you will rewarded with a slew of passing tests and perhaps Javascript enlightenment.
