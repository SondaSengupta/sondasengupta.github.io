If you know the MVC pattern already but you've never done ASP.NET web applications, then this tutorial is a very good teacher. It doesn't matter that it is 2 years old, Rick will explain step-by-step and line by line how the code works.

While I was going through the tutorial, I learned a lot more about post and get requests, just how powerful the EntityFramework can be at scaffolding, and performed my first data migration. When I wondered to myself "what does that code line do?", there was Rick a few sentences later saying exactly what it did.

##Features
- Gives you a good starting foundation on ASP.NET with a learn-by-doing approach
- Clear explanations of how the code works
- Numerous links within the tutorial if you want to delve deeper in a particular topic.

##Not For
- This is for Visual Studio Express 2013 for Web or Visual Studio 2013, which is the latest at the time of this writing.
- This uses LocalDB which is installed by default in Visual Studio. This is not for learning about other database systems.
- This does not go over the particulars of the MVC pattern. It is assumed that you are already familiar with it already.
